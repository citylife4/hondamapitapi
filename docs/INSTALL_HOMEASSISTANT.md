# Home Assistant Installation Guide

Complete guide for installing and configuring the Mapit Motorcycle Tracker integration in Home Assistant.

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant 2023.1 or newer
- A Mapit.me account with an active vehicle
- Your Mapit.me login credentials
- AWS Cognito configuration details (see below)

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: HACS Installation (Recommended)

HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) makes installation and updates easier.

1. **Install HACS** (if not already installed):
   - Follow the [HACS installation guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download)

2. **Add Custom Repository**:
   - Open HACS in Home Assistant
   - Click on **Integrations**
   - Click the **⋮** (three dots) in the top right corner
   - Select **Custom repositories**
   - Add repository URL: `https://github.com/citylife4/hondamapitapi`
   - Category: **Integration**
   - Click **Add**

3. **Install the Integration**:
   - In HACS → Integrations, search for "Mapit Motorcycle Tracker"
   - Click on it
   - Click **Download**
   - Choose the latest version
   - Click **Download**

4. **Restart Home Assistant**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Restart**

5. **Add the Integration**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
   - Click **+ Add Integration**
   - Search for "Mapit Motorcycle Tracker"
   - Follow the configuration wizard

### Method 2: Manual Installation

### Step 1: Copy Integration Files

1. Access your Home Assistant configuration directory (where `configuration.yaml` is located)
2. Create a `custom_components` folder if it doesn't exist
3. Copy the entire `custom_components/mapit_tracker` folder into your `custom_components` directory

Your directory structure should look like:
```
config/
├── configuration.yaml
└── custom_components/
    └── mapit_tracker/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── config_flow.py
        ├── device_tracker.py
        ├── sensor.py
        ├── mapit_api.py
        ├── manifest.json
        ├── strings.json
        ├── translations/
        │   └── en.json
        └── README.md
```

### Step 2: Restart Home Assistant

Restart Home Assistant to load the new integration:
- Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Restart**
- Or use the command: `ha core restart` (for supervised installations)

### Step 3: Add the Integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click the **+ Add Integration** button
3. Search for "Mapit Motorcycle Tracker"
4. Click on it to start the configuration

## Configuration

### Finding Your AWS Cognito Details

You need these configuration values:

1. **Email Address** - Your Mapit.me login email
2. **Password** - Your Mapit.me password
3. **AWS Identity Pool ID** - Format: `eu-west-1:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
4. **AWS User Pool ID** - Format: `eu-west-1_XXXXXXXXX`
5. **AWS User Pool Client ID** - Format: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### Method A: Extract from Browser (Easiest)

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the **Network** tab
3. Log in to https://app.mapit.me
4. Filter network requests by "cognito"
5. Look for requests containing these IDs in the payload or headers

#### Method B: From Existing Configuration

If you already have the standalone app configured:
- Check your `settings.py` file for these values:
  - `mappit_identityPoolId`
  - `mappit_userPoolId`
  - `mappit_userPoolWebClientId`

#### Method C: Contact Support

Reach out to Mapit.me support to request your API configuration details.

### Configuration Steps

1. When adding the integration, you'll see a form with 5 fields
2. Enter your email address and password
3. Enter the three AWS Cognito configuration IDs
4. Click **Submit**
5. The integration will validate your credentials
6. On success, your motorcycle will appear as a new device

## Entities Created

After successful setup, you'll have these entities:

### Device Tracker
- `device_tracker.motorcycle` - Location on map

### Sensors
- `sensor.motorcycle_speed` - Speed in km/h
- `sensor.motorcycle_status` - MOVING or AT_REST
- `sensor.motorcycle_battery` - Battery percentage

## Adding to Dashboard

### Quick Map Card

```yaml
type: map
entities:
  - device_tracker.motorcycle
hours_to_show: 2
```

### Detailed Status Card

```yaml
type: entities
title: Motorcycle
entities:
  - entity: sensor.motorcycle_status
    icon: mdi:motorbike
  - entity: sensor.motorcycle_speed
    icon: mdi:speedometer
  - entity: sensor.motorcycle_battery
    icon: mdi:battery
```

### Combined Card

## Example Automations

### Notification When Motorcycle Moves

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Motorcycle Movement Alert"
    description: "Notify when motorcycle starts moving"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.motorcycle_status
        to: "MOVING"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "🏍️ Motorcycle Alert"
          message: "Your motorcycle has started moving!"
          data:

            actions:
              - action: "VIEW_MAP"
                title: "View Location"
```

### Speed Limit Alert

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Motorcycle Speed Alert"
    description: "Alert when speed exceeds 100 km/h"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.motorcycle_speed
        above: 100
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "⚠️ Speed Alert"

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Motorcycle Stopped"
    description: "Notify when motorcycle stops for 5 minutes"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.motorcycle_status
        to: "AT_REST"
        for:
          minutes: 5
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "🏍️ Motorcycle Stopped"
          message: "Motorcycle has been stationary for 5 minutes at {{ state_attr('device_tracker.motorcycle', 'latitude') }}, {{ state_attr('device_tracker.motorcycle', 'longitude') }}"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Appearing

- Ensure you copied all files to `custom_components/mapit_tracker/`
- Restart Home Assistant after copying files
- Check the Home Assistant logs for errors: Settings → System → Logs

### "Cannot Connect" Error

- Verify your internet connection
- Check that Mapit.me service is accessible
- Ensure your email and password are correct

### "Invalid Auth" Error

- Double-check all three AWS Cognito IDs
- Ensure there are no extra spaces in the IDs
- Verify the IDs are from your Mapit.me account

### Entities Not Updating

- Check Settings → Devices & Services → Mapit Motorcycle Tracker
- Look for error messages
- The integration polls every 30 seconds - be patient for updates
- Check Home Assistant logs for API errors

### Token Cache Issues

If authentication fails repeatedly:
1. Go to your Home Assistant config directory
2. Delete the file `.mapit_tokens.json`
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. The integration will re-authenticate

### View Logs

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.mapit_tracker: debug
```

Add this to `configuration.yaml`, restart, and check the logs.

## Uninstalling

1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services
2. Find "Mapit Motorcycle Tracker"
3. Click the three dots menu → Delete
4. Remove the `custom_components/mapit_tracker` folder
5. Restart Home Assistant

## Support & Issues

For problems or questions:
- Check the logs first
- Review this guide
- Open an issue at: https://github.com/citylife4/hondamapitapi/issues

## Privacy & Security

- Your credentials are stored securely in Home Assistant's config entry
- Authentication tokens are cached in `.mapit_tokens.json` (excluded from backups)
- The integration only communicates with Mapit.me servers
- No data is sent to third parties

## Updates

To update the integration:
1. Download the latest version
2. Replace the files in `custom_components/mapit_tracker/`
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Check the release notes for breaking changes
